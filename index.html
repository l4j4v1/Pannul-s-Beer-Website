            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>La Florida hosts a dense population due to its central location and the variety of services it offers to the community. Furthermore, it has strong connectivity with other areas of Santiago. Unfortunately, La Florida lacks university institutions within its territory, leading to a limited student population in this area. With Pannul's Beer, we aim to attract this university audience through our app, which offers incredible discounts to students, as well as promoting sports and charity. It is expected that the presence of students could have a positive impact on the local economy, rejuvenate its streets, and promote integration between students and the local residents.</p>
